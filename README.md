# 💫 About Me:
Hi there! I'm a software developer 😁with a passion for full-stack web development and API deployment, and I specialize in using ASP.NET. Currently, I'm working on an exciting project, an employee portal system that I'm confident will make waves in the industry.<br><br>I'm also a curious learner and have been picking up new skills in node.js and typescript. I believe that to stay ahead of the curve, it's crucial to keep learning and stay updated with the latest technology trends.<br><br>When it comes to my code, I take pride in writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code. I'm a firm believer in the importance of writing code that is not only functional but also maintainable and scalable.<br><br>In my free time, you can find me tinkering with new tech gadgets, exploring the outdoors, or watching anime and movies. I love to stay active and have some fun🫶🏽.<br><br>If you're interested in collaborating on a project or just want to connect, feel free to reach out to me through email or on my socials. I'm always looking for new opportunities to grow and learn as a developer.
